                Peter has a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Actuarial Mathematics from the University of Copenhagen. 
                During his Master’s Peter was abroad at the University of Wisconsin-Madison specializing in Computer Science and Finance. 
                His thesis investigated Machine Learning models for option pricing. Peter’s research interests are numerical methods as well as machine learning in option pricing, trading strategies, and risk management. 
                His research investigates a better understanding of the financial market, which affects everybody indirectly or directly through e.g. pension savings.

                Peter is currently researching complex exotic options. The exotic options investigated are types of basket options, but the method can be applied to a wide range of options.
                These options are known to be hard to risk monitor and price, hence a better understanding of those products is the key to better allocate capital. 
                Peter is working on applying deep learning techniques to an optimal stopping problem for pricing exotic American options. 
                The deep learning models are known for being scalable to high dimensional data making the model suitable for options contingent on many underlying assets.
