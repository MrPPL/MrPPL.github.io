                <h2>Machine learning methods in Option Theory</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the website of Peter Pommergaard Lind, a Ph.D. student in the field of Quantitative Finance at Aalborg University. 
                    My research focuses on the applications of machine learning in option theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Option theory is a branch of Quantitative Finance that deals with the pricing and modeling options. 
                    These instruments give their holders the right, but not the obligation, 
                    to buy or sell an underlying asset(s) at a predetermined price and time(s). 
                    The use of machine learning in option theory has the potential to improve the accuracy 
                    and efficiency of derivative pricing and risk management.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a Ph.D. student, I have had the opportunity to work with leading researchers in the field and to contribute to the development 
                    of novel machine learning techniques for option pricing and risk management. In addition to my research, I have also been involved 
                    in teaching and mentoring activities. I have served as a teaching assistant for 
                    Continuous Time Finance, Financial Derivative, Numerical Analysis, etc.. at Copenhagen and Aalborg University, 
                    and have mentored undergraduate and Masters students in their research projects.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Peter’s research interests are numerical methods as well as <em>machine learning</em> in <em>option pricing</em>, trading strategies, and risk management. 
                    His research investigates neural networks applied to contingent claims, where the aim is more accurate prices and a better understanding of neural networks.
                    Peter's first paper investigates the feature selection issue in the <abbr title="least squares Monte Carlo method">LSM</abbr> model for pricing American-style options.
                    The paper shows the neural network model <abbr title="feedforward neural network Monte Carlo method">FNNMC</abbr> price estimates are more accurate for basket options. Furthermore, 
                    the method overcomes the feature selection issue by training the network. 
                </p>

                    Thank you for visiting my website. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my research, 
                    please do not hesitate to contact me.
