                <h2>Machine learning models in Finance</h2>
                <p>
                    Peter’s research interests are numerical methods as well as <em>machine learning</em> in <em>option pricing</em>, trading strategies, and risk management. 
                    Currently, his research investigates neural networks applied to contingent claims, where the aim is more accurate prices and better understanding of applying neural networks.
                    Peter first paper investigates the feature selection issue in the <abbr title="least squares Monte Carlo method">LSM</abbr> model for pricing American-style options.
                    The paper shows the neural network model <abbr title="feedforward neural network Monte Carlo method">FNNMC</abbr> price estimates are more accurate for basket options. Furthermore, 
                    the method overcomes the feature selection issue by training the network.
